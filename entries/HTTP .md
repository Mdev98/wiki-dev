# HTTP Protocol Documentation

## Introduction
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol that enables the transfer of hypermedia documents, such as HTML. HTTP was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and is widely used for communication between clients (web browsers) and servers.

## Key Concepts
HTTP operates on a client-server model and follows a request-response paradigm. Key concepts include:

- **Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs):** Used to identify resources on the web.

- **Methods:** HTTP defines several methods, including GET (retrieve resource), POST (submit data), and DELETE (remove resource).

- **Status Codes:** Indicate the outcome of the server's attempt to process a request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

## Where to Use HTTP
HTTP is used in various scenarios, including:

- **Web Browsing:** HTTP is the foundation of web browsing, allowing users to request and view web pages.

- **API Communication:** Many web services and APIs use HTTP for communication between clients and servers.

- **Mobile App Development:** HTTP is commonly used in mobile app development to fetch data from servers.

- **IoT (Internet of Things):** Devices in IoT ecosystems often communicate using HTTP for data exchange.

## Basic HTTP Methods
1. **GET:** Requests data from a specified resource.

2. **POST:** Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.

3. **PUT:** Updates a resource or creates a new resource if it doesn't exist.

4. **DELETE:** Requests the removal of a resource.

## Conclusion
HTTP is a fundamental protocol for web communication, facilitating the exchange of information between clients and servers. Understanding its basic concepts and methods is essential for web developers and anyone involved in web-related technologies.
