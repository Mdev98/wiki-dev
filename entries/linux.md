# Linux Documentation

## Introduction
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It has since become a cornerstone of the broader Linux operating system, powering a wide range of devices, from servers to embedded systems.

## Key Features
Linux boasts several key features:

- **Open Source:** Linux is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), allowing users to view, modify, and distribute the source code.
  
- **Multitasking:** Linux supports multitasking, allowing multiple processes to run simultaneously.

- **Security:** Linux provides robust security features, including user permissions, encryption, and a firewall.

## Where to Use Linux
Linux is utilized in various scenarios, including:

- **Server Environments:** Many web servers, cloud services, and data centers run Linux due to its stability and performance.

- **Embedded Systems:** Linux is often used in embedded devices such as routers, smart TVs, and IoT devices.

- **Development:** Developers often use Linux for software development due to its powerful command-line interface and development tools.

- **Desktop Computing:** Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian offer user-friendly desktop environments.

## Basic Linux Commands
