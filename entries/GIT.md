# Git Documentation

## Introduction
Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)** designed for collaborative software development. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is widely used to track changes in source code, providing a robust way to manage and coordinate work among multiple contributors.

## How Git Works
Git maintains a **repository**, a collection of files and their entire change history. Contributors have local copies of the repository, and changes are tracked through **commits** and organized into **branches**. The decentralized nature allows parallel development and experimentation. The central repository serves as a hub for collaboration, enabling developers to pull and push changes seamlessly.

## Where to Apply Git
Git is commonly used in various scenarios, including:

- **Software Development:** Tracking changes and collaborating on source code.
- **Documentation:** Managing collaborative content projects.
- **Data Science:** Tracking changes in analysis scripts and notebooks.
- **Web Development:** Managing website projects.
- **Open Source Contributions:** Many open-source projects rely on Git.

## Basic Git Commands
1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. `git clone [repository_url]`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
3. `git add [file]`: Adds a file or changes to the staging area.
4. `git commit -m "message"`: Commits changes with a descriptive message.
5. `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
6. `git push`: Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.
7. `git branch`: Lists and creates branches.
8. `git merge [branch]`: Merges changes from a specified branch.
9. `git status`: Shows the status of changes.
10. `git log`: Displays a log of commits.

## Conclusion
Git is a powerful tool for version control, facilitating efficient collaboration and
