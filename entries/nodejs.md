# Node.js Documentation

## Introduction
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.

## Key Features
Node.js offers several key features:

- **Asynchronous I/O:** Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.

- **NPM (Node Package Manager):** NPM is the package manager for Node.js, providing a vast ecosystem of reusable modules and packages.

- **Single Language:** With Node.js, both server-side and client-side code can be written in JavaScript, promoting code reuse and consistency.

## Where to Use Node.js
Node.js is commonly used in various scenarios, including:

- **Web Servers:** Node.js is well-suited for building lightweight and fast web servers.

- **API Development:** Node.js is popular for creating RESTful APIs due to its non-blocking I/O.

- **Real-time Applications:** It's used for developing real-time applications like chat applications and online gaming.

- **Build Tools:** Node.js is often used in build tools and task runners, such as Grunt and Gulp.

## Basic Node.js Commands
1. `node [filename]`: Executes a JavaScript file using the Node.js runtime.
2. `npm init`: Initializes a new Node.js project and creates a `package.json` file.
3. `npm install [package]`: Installs a Node.js package locally.
4. `npm install -g [package]`: Installs a Node.js package globally.
5. `const fs = require('fs')`: Imports the Node.js File System module in a JavaScript file.
6. `const http = require('http')`: Imports the Node.js HTTP module for creating a web server.
7. `npm start`: Runs the script specified in the `"start"` field of the `package.json` file.
8. `npm test`: Runs the test script specified in the `package.json` file.

## Conclusion
Node.js is a powerful and versatile JavaScript runtime, well-suited for building scalable and efficient web applications. Its asynchronous and event-driven nature makes it particularly effective for handling concurrent operations.
